● [Gartner ](https://www.pingsafe.com/blog/importance-of-cloud-security-posture-management/)also reports that CSPM solutions can potentially cut down cloud-based security incidents resulting from cloud misconfigurations by an impressive 80%.

● However, the industry's preparedness to tackle cloud security threats is far from encouraging. The [Oracle and KPMG Cloud Threat Report](https://www.oracle.com/in/security/cloud-threat-report/) findings show that 92% of IT practitioners admit their organizations have a cloud security readiness gap.

### Common Cloud Security Challenges Facing Organizations

The cybersecurity threat landscape has metamorphosed drastically in recent times. Cybersecurity analysts opine that a lot must be done to mitigate these challenges completely. Some of the key cloud security challenges facing organizations are:

● Cloud misconfigurations pose a significant threat and expose your IT environment to risks during cloud adoption.

● Unauthorized access and ineffective Identity and Access Management (IAM) & Privileged Access Management (PAM) are some of the major concerns for organizations.

● Insecure interfaces, third-party software, and APIs make the cloud susceptible to cloud-based attacks and need attention.

● In a shared responsibility model, gaining visibility into cloud assets is challenging.

● There is a shortage of trained cloud security resources and skills.

● Ensuring proper cloud data governance, risk management, and compliance is challenging with the old working methods.

● Shadow IT in the cloud, VM sprawl (uncontrolled growth and excessive deployment of virtual machines or VMs), and VM escape (security vulnerability where an attacker breaks out of a VM) are problematic.

● The attack surface continuously evolves, and managing security in multi-cloud and hybrid-cloud environments is complex.

### **Maximizing Cloud Advantages: Why Should Organizations Use CSPM?**

Using CSPM has multiple benefits, and adopting CSPM can help minimize information security risks. With more organizations adopting the cloud, cyber threats have increased, and so have the challenges. Hence, organizations require a concerted approach to prioritize cloud security and protect their businesses. CSPM could be the ideal mitigation strategy every business enterprise must adopt to neutralize the most severe threats facing cloud computing today.

● CSPM helps proactively identify and mitigate risks, thwarting cyber threats from exploiting security loopholes by quickly detecting vulnerabilities, cloud misconfigurations, and security gaps.

● Cyber threats keep evolving as cybercriminals keep improvising their strategies. CSPM allows organizations to monitor the cloud environment and manage cloud security risks continuously. Thus, they ensure compliance in the cloud, enabling organizations to upscale their cybersecurity strategies.

● CSPM uses state-of-the-art practices and compliance templates to address compliance to industry standards and frameworks like PCI DSS and SOC2 for identifying drifts and insecure cloud infrastructure configurations. Thus, it enables organizations to remain updated with the impending threats, allowing for prompt remediation.

● Time is money in today's fast-paced business environment. CSPM automates policy enforcement and risk remediation to save time and overcome the expense of manually resolving cybersecurity issues across cloud environments.
